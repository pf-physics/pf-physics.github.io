abstract = """Black holes in dimensions > 4 can take on new properties and topologies
  compared to those in 4 dimensions. We examine the Myers-Perry black hole,
  a rotating black hole in D > 4 dimensions and take it to the ultra-spinning
  limit. In this limit, where the horizon exhibits two widely separated length scales,
  we explicitly show that Myers-Perry black holes are described by the blackfold
  effective theory up to first order in a derivative expansion. We conjecture that
  the second order blackfold approximation of Myers-Perry black holes can be
  obtained by applying the fluid/gravity correspondence. Using results obtained
  in this manner, we examine the expected higher order metrics and associated
  energy-momentum tensors. We review the comparison of the Gregory-La
  amme
  instability to hydrodynamic perturbations."""

For the past few years I have organized elaborate Halloween parties with an accompanying app. The app presents the players with a story, along with tasks they must complete to progress the plot. Most of the 'tasks' are Halloween games I've come up with (complete with drinking rules), along with some riddle solving. The apps cannot be played without the real life activities, but one can still explore the apps with the codes provided on the github page. The web apps were designed for mobile, but still work fine on desktop." ]

When their host's back is turned they encounter his REAL friends, who express their disdain for the old man. Upon visiting the oracle, the guests learn that there is a strange dark power in the manor and urges them to investigate. If the guests lose enough health (by performing badly in games), they will become ghosts and attempt to turn the remaining guests into ghosts as well."

The guests are split up into two groups: mystics (consisting of witches, vampires and werewolves) and undead (skeletons, zombies, ghosts). Both groups are informed separately that, although the moon is full, its power is dull and that the OTHER group is responsible for its state. To solve this dispute, a series of challenges have been put forth to determine which group is superior. As they complete challenges, they find evidence that something much darker could be responsible for the moon's weakness. Depending on the species, different abilities are gained to interfere with the other team. The app was made in React" ]
