Can pass in url with flags

npm install -g elm elm-test elm-css elm-live
Use elm-live (must npm init in the folder first)
elm-live src/Main.elm --pushstate
(Allows url parse to actually work)

elm make src/Main.elm --output=main.js
To embed in file

I might actually have to do (without output?):
elm make src/Main.elm

On github will have to parse urls using #
Oh well
